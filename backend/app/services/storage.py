"""
File storage abstraction.

Why an abstraction here? Because the PRD requires S3 in production, but
we want to develop and test locally without AWS credentials. By hiding
the storage details behind a simple interface, switching from local → S3
is a config change, not a code rewrite.

Usage:
    storage = get_storage_service()
    path = await storage.save_file(file, "videos/instructor-123/video.mp4")
    url = await storage.get_file_url("videos/instructor-123/video.mp4")
    await storage.delete_file("videos/instructor-123/video.mp4")
