"""
Coaching analysis service — sends transcripts to Claude for evaluation.

This service:
1. Takes a transcript and instructor name
2. Builds the coaching prompt (from prompts.py)
3. Sends it to Claude 3.5 Sonnet via the Anthropic API
4. Parses the response into a structured report
5. Extracts metrics from the report for historical tracking

Key Anthropic API details:
- Model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514 (best balance of quality and cost)
- Temperature: 0.3 (low = more consistent/reproducible analysis)
- Max tokens: 8192 (enough for a comprehensive report)
- The transcript goes in the user message, coaching framework in system prompt

Cost per evaluation (from PRD):
- ~50K input tokens (transcript + prompt)
- ~8K output tokens (report)
- ≈ $0.38 per evaluation
