Adult Learning Coaching Agent — FastAPI Application

This is the entry point for the backend. It:
1. Creates the FastAPI app instance
2. Configures CORS (so the React frontend can talk to us)
3. Registers route handlers
4. Sets up startup/shutdown lifecycle events

Run with:
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
